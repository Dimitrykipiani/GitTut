I met that girl yesterday
she made me dream of her all the time
as I am lying here tryin to fill the rhymes
the ship of love is slowly entering a bay.

I went to the same place that I saw her
hoping to make my sweet dreams alive
but she showed up with the different guy aside
and the last thing I want now is to be sober
